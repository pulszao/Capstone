# CS50w Capstone - Stocks Manager

## Description

This project is a stock manager website, where you can search and keep track of your stocks and also read some business news. I believe that it might be helpful for the investors to keep track of some stocks and their performance.

### Here you are able to:
- Read some stock market news;
- Add stocks to your watchlist;
- Add your transactions (buy or sell operations);
- Keep track of your portfolio based on your transactions (quantity, rentability, average price, etc.);
- and search for a specific stock graphic.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

Considering its usability and purpose, this project is unique among all tasks assigned during the course.
To build it, I used all languages (HTML, CSS, Scss, Python, Javascript) and frameworks (Django) learned during this period. It also uses some API services to get data for the news and for the stocks quotation/graphic, and I styled it (with a little help from bootstrap) to be nice looking and responsive as well. Therefore, I believe it satisfies the 'distinctiveness and complexity' requirements.
